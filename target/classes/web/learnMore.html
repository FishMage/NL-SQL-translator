    <h1>Building SQL Queries with a Natural Language Interface</h1>
    <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
    <h3>
        SQL language is a powerful tool for manipulating
        data stored in database systems. However, writing
        SQL scripts can be hard and tricky, especially when
        complex relations and logic are involved. Some-
        times a hundred lines of SQL code is needed to
        complete a single request from a user. In compar-
        ison, natural language is much easier for a human
        user to understand and use, so if we can take ad-
        vantage of the user-friendliness of natural language
        and make it a powerful tool to write SQL queries, it
        would be ideal. To realize this function we need to
        rst overcome the ambiguity and complexity in a
        natural language [1] such as English and then nd
        a way to translate it into SQL queries precisely and
        correctly.
        Natural Language Processing(NLP) has been
        an emerging area in machine learning in recent
        decades and it has enhanced the ability of ma-
        chines to read, process and even understand the
        natural language. Accordingly, the interaction level
        between human and machine is greatly improved.
        There are some existing NLP tools which can allow
        us to parse and mark natural language statements.
        This project is going to build a Natural Language
        Interface for SQL(relational databases) using some
        NLP tools and mechanism so that we can query
        the database more easily with common natural lan-
        guages like English. Specically, we will use paper
        by Li and Jagadish [2] as our main reference and
        implement a mechanism to convert simple written
        natural language statements into SQL queries. Fur-
        thermore, we will develop a set of methods to an-
        alyze and evaluate the result to see whether the
        mechanism could return a desirable output. There
        are some existing solutions in academia. For this
        project, we will exam and analyze those solutions
        and explore a new combination of technologies and
        mechanism to solve the problem.</h3>
